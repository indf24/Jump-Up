What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?

Automatically Collected Information
The Application may automatically collect certain information, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your device’s unique identifiers, IP address, operating system, and information about how you use the Application. This data is primarily collected by third-party services like AdMob to serve ads and improve user experience.

The Application uses third-party services, such as AdMob, which may collect, use, and share data as described in their privacy policies. Only aggregated and anonymized data is transmitted to third-party services for improving the Application.

The Service Provider may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:
    As required by law (e.g., to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process);
    When the Service Provider believes disclosure is necessary to protect their rights, safety, or to respond to government requests;
    With trusted service providers who operate on behalf of the Service Provider, under strict terms to protect your data.
