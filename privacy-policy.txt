This Privacy Policy explains how your data is collected, used, and shared when you use Jump Up (the "App"), a mobile game developed by Ruben Ferreira ("I", "me", or "my"). By using the App, you agree to the practices described below.  

----------------------------------------  

1. INFORMATION COLLECTED  
The App itself does not directly collect personal data (e.g., name, email, address). However, third-party advertising and analytics services integrated into the App may automatically collect:  
- Device Information: Device type, OS version, unique identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID), and IP address.  
- Usage Data: Session length, gameplay interactions, and ad engagement.  
- Approximate Location: Coarse location inferred from your IP address (used for ad targeting).  

----------------------------------------  

2. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES  
The App uses the following services for ads and analytics:  
- IronSource (Privacy Policy: https://www.is.com/privacy-policy/)  
- UnityAds (Privacy Policy: https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy)  
- Google AdMob (Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy)  

These services may collect data to:  
- Serve personalized or non-personalized ads.  
- Measure ad performance and prevent fraud.  
- Analyze gameplay trends to improve the App.  

----------------------------------------  

3. CONSENT AND COMPLIANCE  

GDPR (European Users):  
If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), the App uses Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP) to request your consent for personalized ads. You may:  
- Withdraw consent via device settings or the App’s consent form.  
- Request data deletion by contacting third-party providers directly.  

CCPA (California Users):  
Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):  
- The App signals "do not sell" requests to ad partners.  
- Opt out of personalized ads via Google account settings or the UMP consent form.  

COPPA (Children’s Privacy):  
The App is intended for a general audience and is not specifically directed at children under 13. However, we recognize that children may access the App. To comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA):  
- We do not knowingly collect personal information from users under 13.  
- If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information, please contact us at rubenferreira300@gmail.com so we can promptly delete it.  
- We work with third-party ad networks (e.g., IronSource, UnityAds, AdMob) to ensure compliance with COPPA, including serving non-personalized ads to users under 13.  

----------------------------------------  

4. DATA RETENTION  
- Data collected by third parties is retained according to their policies (see links above).  
- I retain aggregated, anonymized data only for App improvement.  

----------------------------------------  

5. YOUR RIGHTS  
- Opt Out of Personalized Ads: Use the consent form in the App or adjust preferences in your device settings (e.g., reset Advertising ID on Android).  
- Delete Data: Contact third-party providers directly or email me at rubenferreira300@gmail.com for assistance.  

----------------------------------------  

6. SECURITY  
I implement industry-standard measures to protect your data. However, no method of electronic transmission is 100% secure.  

----------------------------------------  

7. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY  
Updates will be posted here. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance.
